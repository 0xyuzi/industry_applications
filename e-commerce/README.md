# The analytical tools and knowledge

## Finding if two products are substitutes or complements
Use the shop carts information to analyze,
To find out how two products are complements, we could use complement ratio, 

## Complement ratio for quantify the complement property
Complement Ratio = $$ \frac {A \bigcap B}{A \bigcup B} $$

The more the this ratio is close 1, the more the A and B are complements

## Substitutes ratio for quantify the substitues property
Substitutes ratio = $$ \frac {A \bigcap B} {\min(A, B)} $$
